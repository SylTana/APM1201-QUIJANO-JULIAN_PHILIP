    "### Write a Python program that simulates a music streaming service. Your system should support the following functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Users can \"subscribe\" to different music genres.\n",
    "#### Users can view their subscribed genres and discover new music.\n",
    "#### Users can play a list of songs from their subscribed genres.\n",
    "#### To implement this system, you will need to gather songs from various genres that are available for free or in the public domain on the Internet. Each genre should have a collection of songs that users can browse and play.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "#### Implement a MusicStreamingService class with methods for subscribing to genres, viewing subscriptions, and playing songs.\n",
    "#### Create a Song class that includes attributes like title, artist, and duration.\n",
    "#### Ensure that users can browse available genres and the songs within each genre before making a subscription.\n",
    "#### Use an external source (like a public domain music database or website) to populate your list of available songs for users to explore.\n",
    "### Bonus:\n",
    "#### Allow users to create custom playlists based on their subscribed genres and save them for later playback.\n",
    "#### Implement a feature to search for songs by title or artist."
